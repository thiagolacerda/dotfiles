# dotfiles

Bash configuration forked from [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and adapted to my preferences

## Install (open file to see options)

    ./setup.sh

For a Mac you might want to install homebrew and required packages for the bash configuration in this project. For that,
    run:

    ./brew.sh
